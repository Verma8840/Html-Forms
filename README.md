# Html-Forms
In HTML, a "form" is a crucial element that allows users to input data, which can then be submitted to a web server for processing. Forms are commonly used for various purposes, such as user registration, login, search, data submission, and more. They provide a structured way to collect user information and interact with a website.

Here's a description of the main components and attributes related to HTML forms:

<form> Element: This is the core element used to define a form. It contains all the form controls and elements. The action attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted, and the method attribute defines the HTTP method to be used for the submission (usually "GET" or "POST").
